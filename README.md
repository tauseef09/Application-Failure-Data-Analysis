# Application-Failure-Data-Analysis
This data analysis challenge was prepared by Kaggle. The goal was to build a model that achieves the highest
balanced accuracy to predict application failure given some properties of the computer. Popular data analysis techniques
like oversampling, robust scaling, and ensembling have been used for the purposes of this analysis.
